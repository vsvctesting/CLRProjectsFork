/// Why extension methods? Extension methods enable you to "add" methods to existing types without creating a new derived type
/// The extension methods are static methods, but they're called as if they were instance methods on the extended type. 
/// 
/// When using an extension method to extend a type whose source code you aren't in control of, you run the risk that a change in the implementation of the type will cause your extension method to break.
